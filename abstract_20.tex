CapsGraph framework applies successful deep-learning models on multi-dimensional spatial knowledge graphs. In this process, we extract semantic knowledge graph from text documents, transform graph into vectors using node prioritization. We generate Heterogeneous Information Network from node attributes and edge information of knowledge graph. We generate embedding model based on CapsNet for Neural Network where each capsule is group of neurons whose activity vector is instantiated with vectors of HIN. We apply this methodology for similarity search of document from collection of inordinate number of documents.
