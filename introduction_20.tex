\section{Introduction and motivation}
\label{sec:introduction}
The domain of knowledge graph generated from text data is variable based on data, unlike graph generated from Social Networks where domain is fixed. Here, we capture their structure, node attributes and edge attributes for learning which makes this a data-driven approach to generate network embedding. Furthermore, knowledge extraction from text is a complex problem that introduces noise. By using embedding that is a higher level abstraction provides estimation that is similar to cognitive inference. 

Capsule networks (referred to as CapsNets), which are proposed as an alternative counterpart to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Here we introduce a powerful new approach for learning generative models over knowledge graphs using CapsNet, which can capture their structure with node and edge attributes. Our approach uses CapsNet to express probabilistic dependencies among a graph's nodes and edges, and can, in principle, learn distributions over any arbitrary graph. In a series of experiments our results show that once trained, our models are efficient for document similarity and classification.
