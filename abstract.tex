\begin{abstract}
CapsGraph is an algorithmic framework for unsupervised learning  of diverse spatial knowledge graphs using Capsule Networks. In this process, we extract semantic knowledge graph from text, transform graph into vectors using node prioritization. We represent each node and it's neighboring nodes as vectors. We use CapsNet for Neural Network where each capsule is group of neurons whose activity vector is instantiated with our node vector of HIN. The length of each activity vector becomes probability of similar node. When multiple predictions of adjacent node agrees, it produces higher level capsule. This process is iterative. TODO
